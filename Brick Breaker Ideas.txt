Brick Breaker Game (DMS module Coursework)

Modifications to be added
1. 2 new bricks to be added (Clay, Steel, Cement, ..., ...).
2. Addition of buffs and debuffs.  Their descriptions will be shown on the tutorial, where it teaches how the players to play.
3. Menu
4. New Mode: Sudden death (Clear before time runs out).
5. Highscore board.
6. There will be multiple lives instead of just 1.  To be precise, the player will start with a maximum health of 3.

NOTE!!
#1 This is not a level-based game.  It's an arcade game which is a one-time-play and the map is generated randomly/fixed.  However,
the bricks are confirmed to be generated randomly even if the map is decided to be fixed later on.

== Elaborations ==
1. The 2 new bricks will be randomly generated in a game and there will be a limit on to how much 1 game can have.

Addition of first brick:
- Name: Concrete
- Number per game: 10
- Strength: Between Steel and Cement
- Drops: BOTH debuffs and buffs

Addition of second brick:
- Name: Graphene
- Number per game: 5
- Strength: After Cement (Strongest)
- Drops: ONLY buffs

2. Current ideas for the buffs and debuffs will be listed as the following:

Addition of first buff:
- Name: Sugar rush
- Duration: 15 seconds
- Effect(s): Increases the movement speed of the slab.
- Description:

Addition of second buff:
- Name: Elongation pill
- Duration: 15 seconds
- Effect(s): Increases the length of the slab by twice of its original length.
- Description:

Addition of third buff:

- Effect(s): The speed of the ball will be slowed by half.
- Description:

Addition of fourth buff:
- Name: First aid

- Effect(s): Increases the number of lives by 1.  If the player's health is at max, which is 3, it will be nullified instead.
